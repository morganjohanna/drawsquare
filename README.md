# Draw Square
*Draws a square in the terminal per user input*

## Design and Implementation
- Familiarize with class Canvas and class TerminalScribe function, provided as part of a [LinkedIn Learning course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-essential-training-14898805) by Ryan Mitchell
- Add variables for user input of square and loops to plot the square
- Add loop in case square size input is too large for the canvas

## Next
I'd like to expand this with other shapes (triangle, rectangle, parallelogram), also determined by the user.
